# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview

**Project**

This is a project about traveling across the US. I built the html code from what I learned in the previous projects as well as built a photo grid. I also used flexbox to position items within the sections. I used overlay and hover, as well as adding links to the page. Figma was used as the project brief and this is where I obtained images, font sized as well as margins and image sizes. I committed the project to github and opened a live page.

**Going Forward**

Going forward I hope to improve my skills with flexbox, grid, BEM, HTML and CSS, as well as Git. I am looking forward to also learning JavaScript.
